# KiCad-parts-library
All the additional parts for KiCad which I downloaded or created myself - and which I use for my electronics projects.

Just clone the repo, add the /JLC2KiCad_lib folder into KiCad as a path called "GLOWINGKITTYPARTS" and add the symbol and footprint libraries from this repo into your KiCad settings.
